# Lox Lexer
A lexer for the Lox programming language.  I've set up the basic skeleton for you already, your task is to fill in the sections with `todo`.  You can run the unit tests with `cargo test`.

You can find the grammar that needs to be lexed in `grammar.txt`.  You can also refer to the unit tests to help you understand how character strings should be rendered into tokens.
